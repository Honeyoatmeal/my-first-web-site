  <h2>STEP ONE</h2>
  <p>HARRY
  You've gotta take what you've got
  Even when your life is in knots
  You take aim, take your shot
  Sometimes, you've got to re-write the plot
  You've got to take what you've got
  CHARLIE
  You'd always say that one of these days
  You'd get out of Northampton town
